# Althub-task-
Assigned task by team lead regarding Capstone Project Altschool Africa Tinyuka Cohort 2024
Analysis of Survey Questions 7‚Äì9
üß† Purpose of the Task
As part of our user research efforts for the MediSync health app, I analyzed open- and close-ended responses from our user survey‚Äîspecifically focusing on Questions 7 to 9. This analysis helps us better understand users‚Äô experiences, emotions, and likelihood of adopting a centralized medical record system.

üîç Survey Questions Analyzed
Question 7:

"How would you describe your current experience managing your health information across different hospitals or clinics?"
Type: Open-ended
Goal: Understand user challenges or sentiments regarding fragmented health records.

Question 8:

"What feelings do you associate with having all your health data in one place? (Select up to 3)"
Type: Multi-response (qualitative sentiment)
Goal: Identify emotional responses and expectations from potential users.

Question 9:

"If a trusted system like MediSync could give you a secure, all-in-one medical record, how likely are you to embrace it?"
Type: Close-ended (Likert scale)
Goal: Measure user readiness and willingness to adopt the solution.
